**Note:** The latest stable alpha version is `0.1.0-alpha.200`. After this version, I have started major rebuilding of the app to support desktop platforms and `slikker_kit 1.1.0`.

To check the latest stable alpha version, navigate to [`v0.1.0-alpha.200` branch](https://github.com/AlexBesida/SlikkerTasker/tree/v0.1.0-alpha.200).

## Build app

### 1. Clone the repository.
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/AlexBesida/SlikkerTasker.git
```
### 2. Clone `slikker_kit` repository.
`slikker_kit` right now is during active development as `SlikkerTasker`, so i do not push updates to pub.dev as often as commit new changes.
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/AlexBesida/slikker_kit.git
```
### 3. Navigate to cloned folder, and install packages.
```shell
$ flutter pub get
```
### 4. Run the app.
```shell
$ flutter run
```
